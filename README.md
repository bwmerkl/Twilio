# Twilio Cover Letter
16 September 2021

Dear Natalie Johnson Charles + the Twilio team,

I’m applying for the Senior Director, Content Marketing and Strategy position at Twilio. I believe I'm a great fit for Twilio and vice versa. Here's why. 

As a professional, I’ve completed the content marketing hat trick: freelance, agency, and in-house. As with width, so with depth: I’ve worked at every level of the editorial stack, from copywriting, editing, publishing, and implementing SEO, all the way up to overseeing vendors, hiring staff, coaching writers, managing projects, building processes, and crafting long-term strategy. Along the way, I’ve used much of the marketer’s toolbox: Google Analytics, HubSpot, Marketo, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office, Trello, WordPress, etc.

The two aspects I love most about leading an editorial team are (1) solving an audience's problems through storytelling and the written word and (2) multiplying those efforts by building systems and processes that scale.

First, I believe an effective content team solves an audience's problems by **wearing the customer's shoes** (which is also my approach to SEO). And since content is the oil in a marketing engine — i.e., it touches every team — **being inclusive** is essential to success. Lastly, leading a team means **empowering others**: I love to coach writers and editors to sharpen their craft and outgrow their current role, and even one day replace me in my own position.

Second, building editorial processes is a meta-exercise in **drawing the owl**: it requires bringing a whole parliament of other teams' drawn-owls into one picture. Of course, creating systems also requires **writing it down** — so that the system scales beyond mere tribal knowledge transfer — and **ruthless prioritization**, so that the content strategy stays focused. Finally, content must be held accountable to bottom-line results: **no shenanigans** allowed.

I'd love to put all of the above experience, skills, and passions to work at Twilio as your next Senior Director, Content Marketing and Strategy. 

Let me know if you think I'd make a great Twilion. I'm excited to start building something great.

All the best,

—Bryce Merkl Sasaki
